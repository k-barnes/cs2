You should copy in your graph implementation from day11 including the DiGraphReader. You will use your graph implementation to support implementing two different path finding algorithms. DepthFirstSearcher will implement a depth first graph search and conform to the ISearcher interface. BreadthFirstSearcher will implement a breadth first graph search and conform to the ISearcher interface.

We will test your searcher implementations with several graph files. Sometimes a path will exist from the starting node to the target node, sometimes there will not be a path.

You should feel free to use any data structures you have implemented earlier in the block when implementing your searchers.

IGraphReader.java  - An interface for reading in graph files
DiGraphReader.java - This file isn't included, please include your day11 implementation
ISearcher.java     - An interface for classes that provide graph searches.
graphfile.cs2      - A simple graph file for a basic test
BreadthFirstSearcher.java   - A class that implements the ISearcher interface and preforms a breadth first searcher
DepthFirstSearcher.java     - A class that implements the ISearcher interface and preforms a depth first searcher
LinkStack.java              - A stack class used to make the depth first search (NOTE that I added a function to this class)
