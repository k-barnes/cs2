This directory contains most of the code to implement a RPN calculator in JAVA. You will need to add a queue implementation and a stack implementation to complete the project. After implementing and testing your queue and stack, you will need to update RPN.java to instantiate your implementations. No other changes should be needed to complete the scaffold code.

The RPN calculator functions on the command line and interprets all values as doubles. Since the shell converts * to filenames, when using the * operator you will need to put it in quotes.

So that you can get a sense of how the program works before your implementation is complete, compiled byte code is included for a ring queue and linked list based stack. _DO_NOT_INCLUDE_THESE_.class_FILES_IN_YOUR_SUBMISSION_.

Usage Examples:
kiera:rpn dellswor$ java RPN 1 2 3 + '*'
Answer is: 5.0
kiera:rpn dellswor$ java RPN 6 3 / 1 -
Answer is: 1.0
kiera:rpn dellswor$ java RPN 1 1 1 1 1 + 1 1 1 1 1 + 1 + + + + + + + + +
Underflow when popping stack
Answer is: 0.0
kiera:rpn dellswor$ java RPN 1 1 1 1 1 + 1 1 1 1 1 + 1 + + + + + + + +
Answer is: 11.0
